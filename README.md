# GuidomiaIOS
 Mobile Practical Test (Android and Ios) Objectives:
- Develop a working mobile application
- Use a git repo and share it, we want to see your commits
- The visual must be as close as possible to the mock-up
- Please accomplish as many levels as you are comfortable with.
Do not proceed with the next level, until the current level is completely implemented.
- Please make sure all dependencies are included in the final project, so we don't have to do any additional setups.
- Do not show part of the UI if itâ€™s not working. Quality over quantity.

  *All the required asset can be found in the zip folder.
Level 1:
- Show a simple list of collapsed items
- Extract the list information from the join json file.
- Show a collapsed list (car image, name, price and rating) :

  1. Level 2:
- Add the expandable section in the list.
- By default, the first item should be expanded.
- On clicking an item, the previous item will collapse, and the new item will expand.
- Pros and cons sections should be shown.
- Be aware there is no limit to the number of bullet point so these should be added dynamically.
2. Level 3:
- Implement the filters
- Add a filter section in the UI
- Create the two filter lists from the json provided: one for the make and one for the model
- Show the result in the dropdown
- On selecting a make or a model, the list should be updated following the filters
Bonus level:
Pull the list once from the json then save the result in a local database. When reopening the app when data are saved, we should show these without pulling these from the json.
Technical stack:
- Kotlin / Swift
- Android Studio 4+ / Xcode 12+
 
 - You can use any other third-party libraries if you can justify their need.
